## Description

This portfolio project showcases all the relevant projects and work experience I have thus far with web development. I chose my strongest projects that show the progression in web development I have made at this point. The theme of this project was meant to be simple and modern, with a minimalistic feel- a style that expresses me and my style in general. I wanted to give a Star Wars twistot it because this is also an expression of who I am.  I chose black and white for its simplicity and modern feel, but also is similar to the style of Star Wars. I created my own logo through Canva that I have as my own home page logo that will redirect the user back to the homepage.
