                    I am a full stack web developer leveraging a Speech Therapy background
                    to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. I recently
                    earned a certificate in full stack development from the
                    University of Berkeley Extension School, with newly developed
                    skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, MySQL, among many
                    others. I've been known as an innovative problem solver passionate about
                    developing apps, with proven success providing technical
                    oversight to day-to-day operations. I leverage my current skill
                    set to provide a better experience for both customers and
                    partners by exhibiting excellent communication skills and an
                    ability to take initiative to prioritize daily tasks. My aim
                    is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience
                    with each project I begin. I have gained the ability
                    to deploy static and dynamic websites, implement complex
                    logical conditions to meet objectives, communicate the basics
                    of serving a web page and how the browser renders code, and
                    understanding in the basics of troubleshooting and enhancing
                    legacy code. Proficient in project management, Microsoft
                    office, data entry, and collaborative work.
