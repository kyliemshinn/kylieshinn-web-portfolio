            <h3>Git-Productive</h3>
            <p>
              Git Productive is a full stack web development application
              designed for the use of developers to have a space for project,
              time, and data management. This site is used to alleviate any
              extra tasks or thinking for the user, as it will set reminders
              when it's time to get up and move around, track the amount of time
              they have worked on a specific project, and let them store and
              access crucial code in an organized fashion to reference later.
            </p>

            <h3>PetHub</h3>
            <p>
              Pethub is a front-end based web application designed for anyone
              interested in responsibly adopting a pet. The user can find pets
              in all areas to adopt but giving the option to donate to animal
              charities if they do not feel ready for the commitment of owning a
              pet but still want to contribute to animals in need.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Team Profile Generator</h3>
            <p>
              Team Profile Generator is a backend generated program designed to
              load team member information and display it in the terminal. This
              backend program is specifically designed around the utilization of
              unit testing. Upon completion of passing all tests in the
              terminal, the program can be run from the command line to generate
              a list of team members and their information.
            </p>
